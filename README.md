Small projects to practice Python

I need to organize this ASAP...but here I'm gonna share my small projects written in Python, both for automation purposes (working with that right now) and for study. 

Right now, the most important code here is Zombie Dice, which was a student project done for a Introduction to Programming course. It replicates the Zombie Dice boardgame on the command line and allows multiple players at once. Originally, I intended to add visual representation of the dice being thrown, but as things often go, I didn't have the time and had to rush the project to deliver it in time. Anyway, I still plan on returning to the project to update it.

Also, for anyone out there looking randomly through my GitHub, I would be interested in collaborating in web scraping and automation projects using Python, and further back-end shenanigans in the future.

I need to take time to make sense of my projects soon. SOON.
